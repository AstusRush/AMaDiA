def pade(T, n=1, numdeg=None):
    """
    Create a linear system that approximates a delay.

    Return the numerator and denominator coefficients of the Pade approximation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : number
        time delay
    n : positive integer
        degree of denominator of approximation
    numdeg: integer, or None (the default)
            If None, numerator degree equals denominator degree
            If >= 0, specifies degree of numerator
            If < 0, numerator degree is n+numdeg

    Returns
    -------
    num, den : array
        Polynomial coefficients of the delay model, in descending powers of s.

    Notes
    -----
