"""
timeresp.py - time-domain simulation routines.

The :mod:`~control.timeresp` module contains a collection of
functions that are used to compute time-domain simulations of LTI
systems.

Arguments to time-domain simulations include a time vector, an input
vector (when needed), and an initial condition vector.  The most
general function for simulating LTI systems the
:func:`forced_response` function, which has the form::

    t, y = forced_response(sys, T, U, X0)

where `T` is a vector of times at which the response should be
evaluated, `U` is a vector of inputs (one for each time point) and
`X0` is the initial condition for the system.

See :ref:`time-series-convention` for more information on how time
series data are represented.

class TimeResponseData:
    """A class for returning time responses.

    This class maintains and manipulates the data corresponding to the
    temporal response of an input/output system.  It is used as the return
    type for time domain simulations (step response, input/output response,
    etc).

    A time response consists of a time vector, an output vector, and
    optionally an input vector and/or state vector.  Inputs and outputs can
    be 1D (scalar input/output) or 2D (vector input/output).

    A time response can be stored for multiple input signals (called traces),
    with the output and state indexed by the trace number.  This allows for
    input/output response matrices, which is mainly useful for impulse and
    step responses for linear systems.  For multi-trace responses, the same
    time vector must be used for all traces.

    Time responses are accessed through either the raw data, stored as
    :attr:`t`, :attr:`y`, :attr:`x`, :attr:`u`, or using a set of properties
    :attr:`time`, :attr:`outputs`, :attr:`states`, :attr:`inputs`.  When
    accessing time responses via their properties, squeeze processing is
    applied so that (by default) single-input, single-output systems will have
    the output and input indices supressed.  This behavior is set using the
    ``squeeze`` keyword.

    Attributes
    ----------
    t : 1D array
        Time values of the input/output response(s).  This attribute is
        normally accessed via the :attr:`time` property.

    y : 2D or 3D array
        Output response data, indexed either by output index and time (for
        single trace responses) or output, trace, and time (for multi-trace
        responses).  These data are normally accessed via the :attr:`outputs`
        property, which performs squeeze processing.

    x : 2D or 3D array, or None
        State space data, indexed either by output number and time (for single
        trace responses) or output, trace, and time (for multi-trace
        responses).  If no state data are present, value is ``None``. These
        data are normally accessed via the :attr:`states` property, which
        performs squeeze processing.

    u : 2D or 3D array, or None
        Input signal data, indexed either by input index and time (for single
        trace responses) or input, trace, and time (for multi-trace
        responses).  If no input data are present, value is ``None``.  These
        data are normally accessed via the :attr:`inputs` property, which
        performs squeeze processing.

    squeeze : bool, optional
        By default, if a system is single-input, single-output (SISO)
        then the outputs (and inputs) are returned as a 1D array
        (indexed by time) and if a system is multi-input or
        multi-output, then the outputs are returned as a 2D array
        (indexed by output and time) or a 3D array (indexed by output,
        trace, and time).  If ``squeeze=True``, access to the output
        response will remove single-dimensional entries from the shape
        of the inputs and outputs even if the system is not SISO. If
        ``squeeze=False``, the output is returned as a 2D or 3D array
        (indexed by the output [if multi-input], trace [if multi-trace]
        and time) even if the system is SISO. The default value can be
        set using config.defaults['control.squeeze_time_response'].

    transpose : bool, optional
        If True, transpose all input and output arrays (for backward
        compatibility with MATLAB and :func:`scipy.signal.lsim`).  Default
        value is False.

    issiso : bool, optional
        Set to ``True`` if the system generating the data is single-input,
        single-output.  If passed as ``None`` (default), the input data
        will be used to set the value.

    ninputs, noutputs, nstates : int
        Number of inputs, outputs, and states of the underlying system.

    input_labels, output_labels, state_labels : array of str
        Names for the input, output, and state variables.

    ntraces : int
        Number of independent traces represented in the input/output
        response.  If ntraces is 0 then the data represents a single trace
        with the trace index surpressed in the data.

    Notes
    -----
    1. For backward compatibility with earlier versions of python-control,
       this class has an ``__iter__`` method that allows it to be assigned
       to a tuple with a variable number of elements.  This allows the
       following patterns to work:

         t, y = step_response(sys)
         t, y, x = step_response(sys, return_x=True)

       When using this (legacy) interface, the state vector is not affected by
       the `squeeze` parameter.

    2. For backward compatibility with earlier version of python-control,
       this class has ``__getitem__`` and ``__len__`` methods that allow the
       return value to be indexed:

         response[0]: returns the time vector
         response[1]: returns the output vector
         response[2]: returns the state vector

       When using this (legacy) interface, the state vector is not affected by
       the `squeeze` parameter.

    3. The default settings for ``return_x``, ``squeeze`` and ``transpose``
       can be changed by calling the class instance and passing new values:

         response(tranpose=True).input

       See :meth:`TimeResponseData.__call__` for more information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : 1D array
            Time values of the output.  Ignored if None.

        outputs : ndarray
            Output response of the system.  This can either be a 1D array
            indexed by time (for SISO systems or MISO systems with a specified
            input), a 2D array indexed by output and time (for MIMO systems

            systems) or a 3D array indexed by state, trace, and time.

        inputs : array, optional
            Inputs used to generate the output.  This can either be a 1D
            array indexed by time (for SISO systems or MISO/MIMO systems
            with a specified input), a 2D array indexed either by input and
            time (for a multi-input system) or trace and time (for a
            single-input, multi-trace response), or a 3D array indexed by
            input, trace, and time.

        sys : LTI or InputOutputSystem, optional
            System that generated the data.  If desired, the system used to
            generate the data can be stored along with the data.

        squeeze : bool, optional
            By default, if a system is single-input, single-output (SISO)
            then the inputs and outputs are returned as a 1D array (indexed
            by time) and if a system is multi-input or multi-output, then
            the inputs are returned as a 2D array (indexed by input and
            time) and the outputs are returned as either a 2D array (indexed
            by output and time) or a 3D array (indexed by output, trace, and
            time).  If squeeze=True, access to the output response will
            remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of the inputs
            and outputs even if the system is not SISO. If squeeze=False,
            keep the input as a 2D or 3D array (indexed by the input (if
            multi-input), trace (if single input) and time) and the output
            as a 3D array (indexed by the output, trace, and time) even if
            the system is SISO. The default value can be set using
            config.defaults['control.squeeze_time_response'].

        Other parameters
        ----------------
        input_labels, output_labels, state_labels: array of str, optional
            Optional labels for the inputs, outputs, and states, given as a
            list of strings matching the appropriate signal dimension.

        transpose : bool, optional
            If True, transpose all input and output arrays (for backward
            compatibility with MATLAB and :func:`scipy.signal.lsim`).
            Default value is False.

        return_x : bool, optional
            If True, return the state vector when enumerating result by
            assigning to a tuple (default = False).

        multi_trace : bool, optional
            If ``True``, then 2D input array represents multiple traces.  For
            a MIMO system, the ``input`` attribute should then be set to
            indicate which trace is being specified.  Default is ``False``.

    As a convenience for parameters `U`, `X0`:
    Numbers (scalars) are converted to constant arrays with the correct shape.
    The correct shape is inferred from arguments `sys` and `T`.

    For information on the **shape** of parameters `U`, `T`, `X0` and
    return values `T`, `yout`, `xout`, see :ref:`time-series-convention`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sys : StateSpace or TransferFunction
        LTI system to simulate

    T : array_like, optional for discrete LTI `sys`
        Time steps at which the input is defined; values must be evenly spaced.

        If None, `U` must be given and `len(U)` time steps of sys.dt are
        simulated. If sys.dt is None or True (undetermined time step), a time
        step of 1.0 is assumed.

    U : array_like or float, optional
        Input array giving input at each time `T`.
        If `U` is None or 0, `T` must be given, even for discrete
        time systems. In this case, for continuous time systems, a direct
        calculation of the matrix exponential is used, which is faster than the
        general interpolating algorithm used otherwise.

    X0 : array_like or float, default=0.
        Initial condition.

    transpose : bool, default=False
        If True, transpose all input and output arrays (for backward
        compatibility with MATLAB and :func:`scipy.signal.lsim`).

    interpolate : bool, default=False
        If True and system is a discrete time system, the input will
        be interpolated between the given time steps and the output
        will be given at system sampling rate.  Otherwise, only return
        the output at the times given in `T`.  No effect on continuous
        time simulations.

    return_x : bool, default=None
        Used if the time response data is assigned to a tuple:

        * If False, return only the time and output vectors.

        * If True, also return the the state vector.

        * If None, determine the returned variables by
          config.defaults['forced_response.return_x'], which was True
          before version 0.9 and is False since then.

    squeeze : bool, optional
        By default, if a system is single-input, single-output (SISO) then
        the output response is returned as a 1D array (indexed by time).  If
        `squeeze` is True, remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of
        the output even if the system is not SISO. If `squeeze` is False, keep
        the output as a 2D array (indexed by the output number and time)
        even if the system is SISO. The default behavior can be overridden by
        config.defaults['control.squeeze_time_response'].

    Returns
    -------
    results : TimeResponseData
        Time response represented as a :class:`TimeResponseData` object
        containing the following properties:

        * time (array): Time values of the output.

        * outputs (array): Response of the system.  If the system is SISO and
          `squeeze` is not True, the array is 1D (indexed by time).  If the
          system is not SISO or `squeeze` is False, the array is 2D (indexed
          by output and time).

        * states (array): Time evolution of the state vector, represented as
          a 2D array indexed by state and time.

        * inputs (array): Input(s) to the system, indexed by input and time.

        The return value of the system can also be accessed by assigning the
        function to a tuple of length 2 (time, output) or of length 3 (time,
        output, state) if ``return_x`` is ``True``.

    See Also
    --------
    step_response, initial_response, impulse_response

    Notes
    -----
    For discrete time systems, the input/output response is computed using the
    :func:`scipy.signal.dlsim` function.

    For continuous time systems, the output is computed using the matrix
    exponential `exp(A t)` and assuming linear interpolation of the inputs
    between time points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sys : StateSpace or TransferFunction
        LTI system to simulate

    T : array_like or float, optional
        Time vector, or simulation time duration if a number. If T is not
        provided, an attempt is made to create it automatically from the
        dynamics of sys. If sys is continuous-time, the time increment dt
        is chosen small enough to show the fastest mode, and the simulation
        time period tfinal long enough to show the slowest mode, excluding
        poles at the origin and pole-zero cancellations. If this results in
        too many time steps (>5000), dt is reduced. If sys is discrete-time,
        only tfinal is computed, and final is reduced if it requires too
        many simulation steps.

    X0 : array_like or float, optional
        Initial condition (default = 0). Numbers are converted to constant
        arrays with the correct shape.

    input : int, optional
        Only compute the step response for the listed input.  If not
        specified, the step responses for each independent input are
        computed (as separate traces).

    output : int, optional
        Only report the step response for the listed output.  If not
        specified, all outputs are reported.

    T_num : int, optional
        Number of time steps to use in simulation if T is not provided as an
        array (autocomputed if not given); ignored if sys is discrete-time.

    transpose : bool, optional
        If True, transpose all input and output arrays (for backward
        compatibility with MATLAB and :func:`scipy.signal.lsim`).  Default
        value is False.

    return_x : bool, optional
        If True, return the state vector when assigning to a tuple (default =
        False).  See :func:`forced_response` for more details.

    squeeze : bool, optional
        By default, if a system is single-input, single-output (SISO) then the
        output response is returned as a 1D array (indexed by time).  If
        squeeze=True, remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of the
        output even if the system is not SISO. If squeeze=False, keep the
        output as a 3D array (indexed by the output, input, and time) even if
        the system is SISO. The default value can be set using
        config.defaults['control.squeeze_time_response'].

    Returns
    -------
    results : TimeResponseData
        Time response represented as a :class:`TimeResponseData` object
        containing the following properties:

        * time (array): Time values of the output.

        * outputs (array): Response of the system.  If the system is SISO and
          squeeze is not True, the array is 1D (indexed by time).  If the
          system is not SISO or ``squeeze`` is False, the array is 3D (indexed
          by the output, trace, and time).

        * states (array): Time evolution of the state vector, represented as
          either a 2D array indexed by state and time (if SISO) or a 3D array
          indexed by state, trace, and time.  Not affected by ``squeeze``.

        * inputs (array): Input(s) to the system, indexed in the same manner
          as ``outputs``.

        The return value of the system can also be accessed by assigning the
        function to a tuple of length 2 (time, output) or of length 3 (time,
        output, state) if ``return_x`` is ``True``.

    For information on the **shape** of parameters `T`, `X0` and
    return values `T`, `yout`, see :ref:`time-series-convention`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sys : StateSpace or TransferFunction
        LTI system to simulate

    T :  array_like or float, optional
        Time vector, or simulation time duration if a number (time vector is
        autocomputed if not given; see  :func:`step_response` for more detail)

    X0 : array_like or float, optional
        Initial condition (default = 0).  Numbers are converted to constant
        arrays with the correct shape.

    input : int
        Ignored, has no meaning in initial condition calculation. Parameter
        ensures compatibility with step_response and impulse_response.

    output : int
        Index of the output that will be used in this simulation. Set to None
        to not trim outputs.

    T_num : int, optional
        Number of time steps to use in simulation if T is not provided as an
        array (autocomputed if not given); ignored if sys is discrete-time.

    transpose : bool, optional
        If True, transpose all input and output arrays (for backward
        compatibility with MATLAB and :func:`scipy.signal.lsim`).  Default
        value is False.

    return_x : bool, optional
        If True, return the state vector when assigning to a tuple (default =
        False).  See :func:`forced_response` for more details.

    squeeze : bool, optional
        By default, if a system is single-input, single-output (SISO) then the
        output response is returned as a 1D array (indexed by time).  If
        squeeze=True, remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of the
        output even if the system is not SISO. If squeeze=False, keep the
        output as a 2D array (indexed by the output number and time) even if
        the system is SISO. The default value can be set using
        config.defaults['control.squeeze_time_response'].

    Returns
    -------
    results : TimeResponseData
        Time response represented as a :class:`TimeResponseData` object
        containing the following properties:

        * time (array): Time values of the output.

        * outputs (array): Response of the system.  If the system is SISO and
          squeeze is not True, the array is 1D (indexed by time).  If the
          system is not SISO or ``squeeze`` is False, the array is 2D (indexed
          by the output and time).

        * states (array): Time evolution of the state vector, represented as
          either a 2D array indexed by state and time (if SISO).  Not affected
          by ``squeeze``.

        The return value of the system can also be accessed by assigning the
        function to a tuple of length 2 (time, output) or of length 3 (time,
        output, state) if ``return_x`` is ``True``.

    choose a realistic time vector. Considers both poles and zeros.

    For discrete-time models, dt is inherent and only tfinal is computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sys : StateSpace or TransferFunction
        The system whose time response is to be computed
    is_step : bool
        Scales the dc value by the magnitude of the nonzero mode since
        integrating the impulse response gives
        :math:`\\int e^{-\\lambda t} = -e^{-\\lambda t}/ \\lambda`
        Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    tfinal : float
        The final time instance for which the simulation will be performed.
    dt : float
        The estimated sampling period for the simulation.

    Notes
    -----
    Just by evaluating the fastest mode for dt and slowest for tfinal often
    leads to unnecessary, bloated sampling (e.g., Transfer(1,[1,1001,1000]))
    since dt will be very small and tfinal will be too large though the fast
    mode hardly ever contributes. Similarly, change the numerator to [1, 2, 0]
    and the simulation would be unnecessarily long and the plot is virtually
    an L shape since the decay is so fast.

    Instead, a modal decomposition in time domain hence a truncated ZIR and ZSR
    can be used such that only the modes that have significant effect on the
    time response are taken. But the sensitivity of the eigenvalues complicate
    the matter since dlambda = <w, dA*v> with <w,v> = 1. Hence we can only work
    with simple poles with this formulation. See Golub, Van Loan Section 7.2.2
    for simple eigenvalue sensitivity about the nonunity of <w,v>. The size of
    the response is dependent on the size of the eigenshapes rather than the
    eigenvalues themselves.
