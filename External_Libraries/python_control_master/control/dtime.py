    """
    Convert a continuous time system to discrete time by sampling

    Parameters
    ----------
    sysc : LTI (:class:`StateSpace` or :class:`TransferFunction`)
        Continuous time system to be converted
    Ts : float > 0
        Sampling period
    method : string
        Method to use for conversion, e.g. 'bilinear', 'zoh' (default)
    alpha : float within [0, 1]
            The generalized bilinear transformation weighting parameter, which
            should only be specified with method="gbt", and is ignored
            otherwise. See :func:`scipy.signal.cont2discrete`.
    prewarp_frequency : float within [0, infinity)
        The frequency [rad/s] at which to match with the input continuous-
        time system's magnitude and phase (only valid for method='bilinear')
    name : string, optional
        Set the name of the sampled system.  If not specified and
        if `copy_names` is `False`, a generic name <sys[id]> is generated
        with a unique integer id.  If `copy_names` is `True`, the new system
        name is determined by adding the prefix and suffix strings in
        config.defaults['namedio.sampled_system_name_prefix'] and
        config.defaults['namedio.sampled_system_name_suffix'], with the
        default being to add the suffix '$sampled'.
    copy_names : bool, Optional
        If True, copy the names of the input signals, output
        signals, and states to the sampled system.

    Returns
    -------
    sysd : linsys
        Discrete time system, with sampling rate Ts

    Additional Parameters
    ---------------------
    inputs : int, list of str or None, optional
        Description of the system inputs.  If not specified, the origional
        system inputs are used.  See :class:`NamedIOSystem` for more
        information.
    outputs : int, list of str or None, optional
        Description of the system outputs.  Same format as `inputs`.
    states : int, list of str, or None, optional
        Description of the system states.  Same format as `inputs`. Only
        available if the system is :class:`StateSpace`.

    Notes
    -----
    See :meth:`StateSpace.sample` or :meth:`TransferFunction.sample` for
    further details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> sysc = TransferFunction([1], [1, 2, 1])
    >>> sysd = sample_system(sysc, 1, method='bilinear')
