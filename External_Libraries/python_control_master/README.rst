Python Control Systems Library
==============================

The Python Control Systems Library is a Python module that implements basic
operations for analysis and design of feedback control systems.

Features
--------

- Linear input/output systems in state-space and frequency domain
- Block diagram algebra: serial, parallel, and feedback interconnections
- Time response: initial, step, impulse
- Frequency response: Bode and Nyquist plots
- Control analysis: stability, reachability, observability, stability margins
- Control design: eigenvalue placement, linear quadratic regulator
- Estimator design: linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter)

Dependencies
============

The package requires numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.  In addition, some routines
use a module called slycot, that is a Python wrapper around some FORTRAN
routines.  Many parts of python-control will work without slycot, but some
functionality is limited or absent, and installation of slycot is recommended
(see below). The Slycot wrapper can be found at:

https://github.com/python-control/Slycot

Installation
============

Conda and conda-forge
---------------------

The easiest way to get started with the Control Systems library is
using `Conda <https://conda.io>`_.

The Control Systems library has been packages for the `conda-forge
<https://conda-forge.org>`_ Conda channel, and as of Slycot version
0.3.4, binaries for that package are available for 64-bit Windows,
OSX, and Linux.

To install both the Control Systems library and Slycot in an existing
conda environment, run::

  conda install -c conda-forge control slycot

Pip
---

To install using pip::

  pip install slycot   # optional; see below
  pip install control

If you install Slycot using pip you'll need a development environment
(e.g., Python development files, C and Fortran compilers).

Installing from source
----------------------

To install from source, get the source code of the desired branch or release
from the github repository or archive, unpack, and run from within the
toplevel `python-control` directory::

  pip install .


Development
===========

Code
----

You can check out the latest version of the source code with the command::

  git clone https://github.com/python-control/python-control.git

Testing
-------

You can run the unit tests with `pytest`_ to make sure that everything is
working correctly.  Inside the source directory, run::

  pytest -v

or to test the installed package::

  pytest --pyargs control -v
