This directory contains various scripts that can be used to measure the
performance of the python-control package.  The scripts are intended to be
used with the airspeed velocity package (https://pypi.org/project/asv/) and
are mainly intended for use by developers in identfying potential
improvements to their code.

Running benchmarks
------------------
To run the benchmarks listed here against the current (uncommitted) code,
you can use the following command from the root directory of the repository:

  PYTHONPATH=`pwd` asv run --python=python

You can also run benchmarks against specific commits using

  asv run <range>

where <range> is a range of commits to benchmark.  To check against the HEAD
of the branch that is currently checked out, use

  asv run HEAD^!

Code profiling
--------------
You can also use the benchmarks to profile code and look for bottlenecks.
To profile a given test against the current (uncommitted) code use

   PYTHONPATH=`pwd` asv profile --python=python <file>.<test>

where <file> is the name of one of the files in the benchmark/ subdirectory
and <test> is the name of a test function in that file.

If you have the `snakeviz` profiling visualization package installed, the
following command will profile a test against the HEAD of the current branch
and open a graphical representation of the profiled code:

  asv profile --gui snakeviz <file>.<test> HEAD
